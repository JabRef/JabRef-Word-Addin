# JabRef-Word-Addin
## Getting started

- Run `yarn install`



## Follow the following steps to start the local web server and install add-in.

- Open Office on the web. Using the Create option, make a document in Word. In this new document, select Share in the ribbon, select Copy Link, and copy the URL.
- In the root directory of office project files, open the package.json file. Within the config section of this file, create a "document" property. Paste the URL you copied as the value for the "document" property. For example, yours will look something like this:
`"config": { 
    "document": "paste here",
    ...
    }
    `
- In the command line starting at the root directory, run `yarn start:web`.
- You will see a second dialog box, asking if you wish to register an Office Add-in manifest from your computer. You should select Yes.
